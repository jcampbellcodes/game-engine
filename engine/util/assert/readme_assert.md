## ASSERTS ##

asserts are very useful for debugging code (you will save headaches if you assert after **every** time you allocate memory)

if we write our own rather than use the standard, we can decide the behaviour for different types of builds and control performance
for asserts used in our code via macros

should be an easy ~50 line file, so worth the trouble probably
